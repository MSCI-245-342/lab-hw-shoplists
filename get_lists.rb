# This statement brings in the code in db.rb, which makes a connection
# to our database and saves it in the constant DB.  
# Be sure you have created the shoplists DB as per the 
# instructions.
require_relative 'db'

#
# In this file, you should write code to display the shopping lists
# by their ID (primary key in the database) and their name/description.
#
# Do not show the contents of the lists.
#
# For example, if our DB has lists "groceries", "tools", and "misc", 
# we would output:
#
# 1 groceries
# 2 tools
# 3 misc
#
# Note that the IDs used will change and can be different.
